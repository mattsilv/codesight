# CodeSight Analyze Command Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The `analyze.sh` command has been refactored from a monolithic ~400 line file into a modular structure. This improves maintainability, makes the code easier to understand, and facilitates future enhancements.

## Changes Made

1. Created a modular structure in `libs/analyze/`:
   - `analyze_main.sh`: Orchestrates the analysis process
   - `file_collection.sh`: Handles file discovery and filtering
   - `file_processor.sh`: Processes file content
   - `output_formatter.sh`: Formats and generates output

2. Added a new token statistics visualization:
   - `utils/visualize/token_stats.sh`: Shows top files by token count
   - Updated `visualize.sh` to add a "tokens" command
   - Updated `help.sh` to document the new command

3. Maintained backward compatibility:
   - Original `commands/analyze.sh` now acts as a wrapper
   - All existing functionality works as before

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility, making the code easier to maintain.
2. **Better Organization**: Code is now organized by functionality rather than being in one large file.
3. **Ease of Extension**: New features can be added to specific modules without affecting others.
4. **Clearer Code**: Smaller files with focused purposes are easier to understand.

## Known Issues

1. There's some duplicate output when running analyze (needs to be fixed in Phase 2)
2. Extension statistics in output_formatter.sh need proper implementation
3. Error handling needs improvement in some edge cases
4. Complete migration will require updating SCRIPT_DIR references

## Next Steps

1. Fix the known issues
2. Add comprehensive tests for each module
3. Complete the migration plan outlined in `libs/analyze/MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
4. Consider creating similar modular structures for other commands

## Command Usage

To use the new token statistics visualization:
```
./codesight.sh visualize tokens
```

Or to customize:
```
./codesight.sh visualize tokens --limit 10
```
